    "Fading examples helps students become more independent as they work onwards through problems.",
    "Conversely compounding problems are sometimes a good fit for homework to give numerous \"easy\" problems followed by some \"stretch\" goals that students can reach for, combining their previous work.",
    "Pair progarmming is proven to improve student learning outcomes, when applied correctly."
