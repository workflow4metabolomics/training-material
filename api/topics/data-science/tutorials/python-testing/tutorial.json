    "The three main types of automated tests are **unit tests**, **functional tests** and **regression tests**.",
    "We can write unit tests to verify that functions generate expected output given a set of specific inputs.",
    "It should be easy to add or change tests, understand and run them, and understand their results.",
    "We can use a unit testing framework like `unittest` to structure and simplify the writing of tests.",
    "We should test for expected errors in our code.",
    "Testing program behaviour against both valid and invalid inputs is important and is known as **data validation**."
