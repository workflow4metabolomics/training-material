    "Virtual environments keep Python versions and dependencies required by different projects separate.",
    "A virtual environment is itself a directory structure.",
    "Use `venv` to create and manage Python virtual environments.",
    "Use `pip` to install and manage Python external (third-party) libraries.",
    "`pip` allows you to declare all dependencies for a project in a separate file (by convention called `requirements.txt`) which can be shared with collaborators/users and used to replicate a virtual environment.",
    "Use `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt` to take snapshot of your project's dependencies.",
    "Use `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to replicate someone else's virtual environment on your machine from the `requirements.txt` file."
