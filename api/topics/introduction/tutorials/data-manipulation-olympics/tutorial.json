    "There are a lot of tools available in Galaxy for performing basic data manipulation tasks",
    "Bacis data manipulation is often needed between steps in a larger scientific analysis in order to connect outputs from one tool to input of another.",
    "There are often multiple ways/tools to achieve the same end result",
    "Having a basic understanding of data manipulation tools will make it easier to do exploratory data analysis",
    "Always read the help text of the tool before using it to get a full understanding of its workings",
    "Always try to formulate the output you are expecting from a tool. This will make it easier to spot mistakes as soon as possible."
