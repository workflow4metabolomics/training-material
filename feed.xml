This year we want to celebrate that by introducing a new theme (<a href="#" onclick="setTheme('blm')">Click to Activate</a>), and taking a look at one of the most famous Black figures in Science: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Lacks">Henrietta Lacks</a> whose contribution to science went unremarked and unappreciated for decades while white scientists took credit for advancements built on her cell line.</p>

<p>Her cell line is the oldest and most commonly used human cell line <span class="citation"><a href="#Rahbari_2009">Rahbari <i>et al.</i> 2009</a></span>, and is the reason for large scale policy change, especially major regulatory changes in informed consent in the United States <span class="citation"><a href="#Beskow_2016">Beskow 2016</a></span>. Unfortunately none of these changes happened quickly, it took until 2013 before her descendants could have a say in how her genetic material is used in NIH research <span class="citation"><a href="#lacks_family_2013">University 2013</a></span>.</p>

<h2 id="johns-hopkins">Johns Hopkins</h2>

<p>Henrietta was a patient at Johns Hopkins Hospital; Johns Hopkins University employs many of the core Galaxy Developers.</p>

<p>Johns Hopkins has announced the construction of a new building named in her honor, specifically focusing on research around bioethics: “The building will support the Berman Institute of Bioethics, the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and additional departments, as well as collaborative space for education, research, and meetings.” <span class="citation"><a href="#jhu_construction_announcement">University 2022</a></span></p>

<h2 id="bioethics">Bioethics</h2>

<blockquote class="quote">
  <p>Lacks’s case is one of many examples of the lack of informed consent in 20th century medicine. Communication between tissue donors and doctors was virtually nonexistent (i.e. cells were taken without patient consent, nor were they told what the cells would be used for). Johns Hopkins Hospital, where Lacks received treatment and had her tissue harvested, was the only hospital in the Baltimore area where African American patients could receive free care. The patients receiving free care from this segregated sect of the hospital often became research subjects without their knowledge. Lacks’s family also had no access to her patient files and had no say in who received HeLa cells or what they would be used for. Additionally, as HeLa cells were popularized and used more frequently throughout the scientific community, Lacks’s relatives received no financial benefit and continued to live with limited access to healthcare. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa#Controversy">via Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We recommend the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Immortal_Life_of_Henrietta_Lacks">“The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks”</a> for further reading on the topic.</p>

<h2 id="gtn-connection">GTN Connection</h2>

<p>The GTN has four tutorials that make use of HeLa cell line data. After reading about Henrietta and her impact on science, you might be interested in following one of these tutorials to learn about the applications of her cells, two on imaging analysis:</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>There is an ongoing explosion of scientific datasets being generated, brought on by recent technological advances in many areas of the natural sciences. As a result, the life sciences have become increasingly computational in nature, and bioinformatics has taken on a central role in research studies. However, basic computational skills, data analysis, and stewardship are still rarely taught in life science educational programs, resulting in a skills gap in many of the researchers tasked with analysing these big datasets.</p>

<p>In order to address this skills gap and empower researchers to perform their own data analyses, the Galaxy Training Network (GTN) has previously developed the Galaxy Training Platform (<a href="https://training.galaxyproject.org">https://training.galaxyproject.org</a>), an open access, community-driven framework for the collection of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) training materials for data analysis utilizing the user-friendly Galaxy framework as its primary data analysis platform.</p>

<p>Since its inception, this training platform has thrived, with the number of tutorials and contributors growing rapidly, and the range of topics extending beyond life sciences to include topics such as climatology, cheminformatics, and machine learning. While initially aimed at supporting researchers directly, the GTN framework has proven to be an invaluable resource for educators as well. We have focused our efforts in recent years on adding increased support for this growing community of instructors. New features have been added to facilitate the use of the materials in a classroom setting, simplifying the contribution flow for new materials, and have added a set of train-the-trainer lessons. Here, we present the latest developments in the GTN project, aimed at facilitating the use of the Galaxy Training materials by educators, and its usage in different learning environments.</p>]]></content><author><name>Bérénice Batut, Saskia Hiltemann, Helena Rasche</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="paper" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our new paper about the Galaxy Training Network has been published this week in Plos Computational Biology: “Galaxy Training: A powerful framework for teaching!”]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/images/2023-01-10-gtn-paper-fig2.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/images/2023-01-10-gtn-paper-fig2.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">New Tutorial Suite: Deconvolution with MuSiC, from public data to disease interrogation!</title><link href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2022/11/29/deconvolution.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New Tutorial Suite: Deconvolution with MuSiC, from public data to disease interrogation!" /><published>2022-11-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-11-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2022/11/29/deconvolution</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2022/11/29/deconvolution.html"><![CDATA[<p>The still new and shiny single-cell analysis topic now boasts a <a href="/training-material/topics/single-cell/index.html">deconvolution tutorial suite</a>!
