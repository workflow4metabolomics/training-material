For this short tutorial, while the workflow is running, these slides can be useful
to explain the tools that are being run in that section. After explaining the tools,
the workflows should be far enough along to start showing the results

## Input: Cellulose Degradation in a Biogas Reactor

![](../../images/metatranscriptomics/experimental_setup.png)



???

A 100 µl aliquot of an enriched community from a biogas reactor was transferred to 27 anaerobic bottles containing a rich medium and 10g/L of cellulose as sole carbon source and incubated at 65 °C.

Three bottles were collected at 9 different time points (0, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, 33, 38 and 43 h) and processed in triplicates. Metatranscriptomic analysis was performed on all time points. Metaproteomics analysis on 4 data points.

---


## Input Format: FastQ Files


- Four lines per read

![](../../../sequence-analysis/images/quality-control/fastq_fig.jpg)

???

- Four lines per read
  - `@` + identifier on first line, just like fasta
  - sequence
  - `+`
  - quality score characters

Segue: so what do the quality chars mean?

---

## FastQ: Quality score

- Each character denotes a different Phred score

  ![](../../../sequence-analysis/images/quality_score_encoding.png)

- Phred scores are logarithmic

.small[
Phred Quality Score | Probability of incorrect base call | Base call accuracy
--- | --- | ---
10 | 1 in 10 | 90%
20 | 1 in 100 | 99%
30 | 1 in 1000 | 99.9%
40 | 1 in 10,000 | 99.99%
...
]

???

- Logarithmic scale
- Different flavours of encoding exist

## Quality Reports: FastQC

- Generate a web report with quality metrics of your FastQ file

![](../../../sequence-analysis/images/fastqc-report.png)

.footnote[see also our [dedicated QC tutorial](/training-material/topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.html)  ]

---

## Quality Reports: FastQC

- Many different QC plots
- Example: Per-base sequence Quality plot

![](../../../sequence-analysis/images/per_base_sequence_quality_good.png)


.footnote[explanation of different plots: [dedicated QC tutorial](/training-material/topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.html)  ]

???
- in the per-base sequence quality plot, a boxplot of the base quality (y-axis) per position in the read (x-axis) is drawn
- often you might observe a drop in quality towards the end of the reads, and may consider trimming ends
- this example is very good

---

## Quality Reports: FastQC

- Many more plots
- See [QC tutorial](/training-material/topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.html) for more information

![](../../../sequence-analysis/images/quality-control/all_plots.png)


---

## Quality Reports: MultiQC

.pull-left[
- Combine multiple FastQC reports into one report

- Also for outputs of other tools

- Great when sequencing large numbers of samples
]

.pull-right[
![](../../images/metatranscriptomics/multiqc.png)
]

---

## Read Trimming and Filtering: Cutadapt

- Trim low-quality bases from reads
- Filter reads based on length, mean quality score, ..
- Remove adapters/primers

  .image-75[![adapter trimming](../../../sequence-analysis/images/quality-control/trimming.png)]

- Many tools: CutAdapt &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-wrench&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;tool&lt;/span&gt;, TrimGalore &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-wrench&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;tool&lt;/span&gt;, Trimmomatic &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-wrench&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;tool&lt;/span&gt; ..

???
These are some examples of ways to trim and filter data, but many more are possible and depend on your experiment what is necessary

---

## SortMeRNA

.pull-left[

- Most RNA sequences will be ribosomal RNA (rRNA)

- Great for taxonomical assignment (who is there?)

- Not informative for functional analysis (What are they doing?)

- Filter out rRNA before doing functional analysis
]

.pull-right[
.image-90[![SortMeRNA](../../images/metatranscriptomics/sortmerna.png)]
]

---

## FastQ interlacer

- Paired-end data often comes in two separate FastQ files
- One file with *forward* reads, one with *reverse* reads

&lt;br&gt;

![paired end deinterlaced file](../../../sequence-analysis/images/mapping/pairedend_fastq.png)

---

## FastQ interlacer

- Some tools require a single **interlaced** FastQ file
- Galaxy has tools for **interlacing** and **deinterlacing** FastQ files

&lt;br&gt;

![paired end interlaced file](../../../sequence-analysis/images/mapping/pairedend_interlaced.png)


???
forward and reverse files are 'zipped' together into a single file

---

## Community Profile

- We want to identify which organisms are present in our sample, and their relative abundances

![](../../images/microbial-community.png)

- **MetaPhlan2** &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-wrench&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;tool&lt;/span&gt; for identification
- **Krona** &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-wrench&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;tool&lt;/span&gt; and **Graphlan** &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-wrench&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;tool&lt;/span&gt; for visualisation

---

## MetaPhlan2 &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-wrench&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;tool&lt;/span&gt;

- Estimates the presence and relative abundance of microbial cells
- Maps reads against a set of marker sequences
- Caveat: this tool is designed for DNA-seq
  - Be careful interpreting abundances when using this tool with transcriptomics data

.footnote[Nat Methods. 2012 Jun 10;9(8):811-4. doi: 10.1038/nmeth.2066.]

???

About the caveat: The theoretical problem is that we quantify species abundance by averaging the coverage of marker genes. Marker genes are supposed to be at the same coverage as they are single copy genes from the same genome, but this is not true for their transcripts. So MetaPhlAn2 on metatranscriptomics gives an idea about the average transcriptional rate of a given species. So it _can_ be used with caution...


---

## Krona &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-wrench&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;visually-hidden&quot;&gt;tool&lt;/span&gt;

???
Takes non rRNA reads + MetaPhlAn2 gives list of abundant organism, then it does Nucleotide level pangenome mapping with Bowtie and uses CHocophlAN db
giving unmapped and organims specific gene hits, the unmapped reads are further searched against accelerated translated protein database
the protein hits are tehn combined with gene hits and metacyc to give the output.

---


**Result:** Gene family and pathway abundances

.image-40[![](../../images/metatranscriptomics/humann2_tiered5.png)]

---

## Gene Families Abundances

![](../../images/metatranscriptomics/gene_family_abundance.png)

RPK (reads per kilobase) = sum of alignment scores

???
Gene families: groups of evolutionary related protein that perform similar function
Pathway: sum over genes catalyzing the reaction
Pathway coverage: presence/absence
RPK relative gene copy number : is computed as the sum of all alignments scores over a particular gene family
UNMAPPED: total number of reads that remained unmapped even after both alignment steps
UNINTEGRATED: no pathway detected.

---

## Gene Families to Functional Annotation

![](../../images/metatranscriptomics/results_functional_annotation.png)

???
Gene familes are too large depending on the complexity thus to simplify users can regroup gene families using grouping tool, can download mapping files.
HUMAnN2 regroups Uniref 50/90 values to Go terms to get a broad overview.

---

## Group Abundances

![](../../images/metatranscriptomics/results_group_abundances.png)


???
Group abundances converts GO terms to Go slim (subset of GO terms) into Mol function, biological process and cellular components.
