# Metabolomics

## Definitions

- Metabolomics
  - Newly emerging field of 'omics' research
  - Comprehensive and simultaneous systematic determination of metabolite levels  in the metabolome and their changes over time as a consequence of stimuli
- Metabolome
  - Refers to the complete set of small-molecule metabolites
  - Dynamic
- Metabolites
  - Intermediates and products of metabolism
  - Examples include antibiotics, pigments, carbohydrates, fatty acids and amino acids
  - Primary and secondary metabolites

Note : before 2005 we talk about Metabo**l**omics and Metabo**n**omics 
- Metabo**_l_**omics
  - Metabolic 'fingerprints' (unique for each type of cell or tissue) based on comprehensive quantification
  - Comprehensive and simultaneous systematic determination of metabolite levels in a biological system (cell, tissue, fluid)
- Metabo**_n_**omics
  - Description of metabolic changes
  - Detection of disrupted metabolic pathways

## Metabolomics : the world of small molecules

.pull-left[
**Physico-chemical diversity**
- Comparison with
  - DNA/RNA: 4 bases
  - Proteins: 20 amino acids
  - Common physico-chemical properties
  - Extraction/Analysis: easy automation

- Metabolites
  - Number ≥ 150 000 in Nature; most not identified
  - Wide diversity of structures, functional groups, physico-chemical properties
  - e.g. lipids, sugars, amino acids, etc.
  - High turn-over rates (&lt;sec)
  - Range from 1 pM to 100 mM

**Molecular mass range**

## Analytical challenge

![Large pathway map with text over it reading: targeted/global, sensitity coverage. Great number of metabolites, 2.5k to 15k. Chemical diversity of metabolites, mass, pKa, polarity, volatiity. Variable concentrations. NMR vs MS. Universality, Sensitivity, Can get both structural and quantitative information. And in red in the center: The metabolome analysis relies on combinations of approaches.](../../images/slide-intro-metabolome_pathway.png)
